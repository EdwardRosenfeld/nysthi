---- there 4 classes of frequencies
---- freq one is spread on 5 octeves
---- freq 2 on 6 octaves
---- freq 3 and4 on low mid and high
---- there are PAN animators and SPECTRUM animators (and AMPLI animators too)
---- this will consume on my MAC about 50% of the resources, so best use is to record it, alone...


-- EQUAL DIVISION QUANTIZER
---- ADD CV in for both N and X variables (of the "N th root of X")
---- REAL TIME change of the display to represent the OCTAVE and TUNING variations too
---- ADD Input and output 2, 3 and 4 to have microtonal chords based on the same scale

-- EQUAL DIVISION QUANTIZER
---- inspired by discussions with Kent, Edward and Scott
        https://www.facebook.com/groups/vcvrack/permalink/171694843490668/
---- It is a grid create using the formula  "Nth root of X" where N is the first field and X the second field
---- You can use and REAL number, so you can have for example a scale  63.333ed1.6666  (63+1/3ed5/3)
---- both N and X fields are draggable editable
---- example N = 12 and X = 2 is the standard western 12th root of 2
---- or N = 25 and X = 5 gives you the Stockhausen's 25ed5 scale
---- the midi map mode, maps the midi notes (scaled 0.083333) to first 127 degree of the current scale
---- the pure quantize mode, quantize to the closest voltage of the grid

----- THE SWELL pot controls from ECHO to infinite feedback (beware)
----- DRY - WET is a mix from original input signal and the processed signal
----- INPUT and OUTPUT have both a gain control

---- implements some of the functionalities of a single channel of the Buchla 227e
---- position of the source can be established with MOUSE, or by X and Y Position
---- or by AZIMUTH and MAGNITUDE, or by SWIRL (a la 227e)
---- the SWIRL is internal LFO that rotates the sound source for teh 4 outputs, with RATE
---- and AMPLI (is the MAGNITUDE, again...)
---- X & Y positioning takes precendece on SWIRL that takes precendece on setting AZIMUTH (and MAGNITUDE) and on

BUG: the QRV section had a WRONG count on N+1 when POT was on 1 (you didn't notice... but I'm picky)
BUG: the SRV SKEW function was overflowing if modulated

v0.5.4  2017-12-03
-- THE SQUONK
it's a PROGRAMMER, STAGE sequencer, Sampler TRIGGER, freely inspired to Serge TKB
is 12 steps with 11 lines of programming

line 1: TRIG IN: will select the stage triggered
line 2: STAGE: is the stage selector by button. when in sequencer mode the current step will light up
line 3: 5X: voltage multiplier for A B C D E channels
line 4: A: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 5: B: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 6: C: CV channel from 0 to 2 volts
line 7: D: CV channel from -1 to 1 volts
line 8: E: CV channel from -1 to 1 volts
line 9: MODE: TRIG mode; if bright yellow, CV and TRIG out, if dark yellow, only CV out, if black step is jumped
line 10: REP: if the sequencer is clocked will retrig the step from 1 to 8 times (subdivisions) (ratcheting)
line 11: TRIG OUT: single PULSE out when the stage is selected

SEL knob: will select the current stage
SEL CV input: selection of stage using CV (0 -> 10v)
CLK IN CLK OUT: to clock the sequencer (and output the same clock to other devices)
UP TRIG and BUTTON: if ON the sequence will go UP (normally is DOWN)
RND btn: if light up the next stage is randomized

OUTS A B C D E are the CV outs of the sequencer
ROT knob, from -5 to +5, is the number of steps the yellow channel will rotate jump and rotate  if in sequencer mode
LAST trig out: PULSE out when last step is reached
TRIG (global): current stage TRIG out (with repetitions if any)
CHAIN A B C D E  and CHAIN TRIG are useful when chaining many SQUONKs (to have just one connection for the CV and TRIGs)

START STOP RESET: sequencer status controls by BUTTON or by TRIG

RANDOMIZE ALL: must be pressed with COMMAND KEY (too dangerous!)

-- SOYMODELSOU
---- IS an imitation of the FLUCTUATING, QUANTIZED and STORED voltages sections of the Buchla 266 Source of Uncertainty
---- FLUCTUATING RANDOM VOLTAGES 1
control TIME via CV and KNOB: from 0.05 to 50 sampling per seconds
OUTS: SMOOTH, HARD (the sampled voltage),  PULSE ( when HARD > 0.5)

---- FLUCTUATING RANDOM VOLTAGES 2
control TIME via CV and KNOB from 0.05 to 50 sampling per seconds
has a different smoothing function that can be controlled via CV
OUTS: SMOOTH, HARD (the sampled voltage),  PULSE (when HARD > 0.5)

---- QUANTIZED RANDOM VOLTAGES
2 sections: 2^n and n+1, where N is form 1 to 6 (established via CV and KNOB)
the n+1 distribution is a Triangular distribution (like throwing 2 dice)

n+1 are in 1V jumps
2^n are in 1/12V jumps

---- STORED RANDOM VOLTAGES
Random with SKEWING function (CV controllable) to have more events in LOW MID or HIGH ranges

-- HOTUNA
---- add TUNE "A = " param (so you can tune to "432Hz" now")
---- addeed TUNE reference OSCILLATOR
---- add DO RE MI mode
---- INSTABILYT light (the background will become lighed RED if reading is invalid)

---- frequency (expressed as MIDINOTE TAG) we are targeting;
---- starts to become GREEN when is at less than 4 % deviation
---- and RED when there is less than 0.5% of deviation

---- the TUNER works on SIGNALs (vco inputs, or any signal you want)
---- and with VOLTAGES (translated interanally in frequencies) + the offset given by the OCTAVE
---- POT (goes from -2 to +2 octaves)

v0.5.0 2017-11-19
- QUADSIMPLER
    - the son of SIMPLER, is a multi sample player with integrated stereo mixer
    - 4 equivalent sample player with
        LOAD sample button (load WAV or AIFF, PCM)
        GATE mode (when in GATE mode the sample will play when the signal is HIGH and STOP when TRIG is LOW)
        1-SHOT
        TRIG BTN (to start a sample manually, or GATE IT)
        TRIG IN (to start a sample with a trig in signal or used in GATE mode)
        STOP IN (a trign signal will stop the sample)
        START will move the start point of the sample
        FM CTRL from -2 to +2, by default is 1 and the input in FMIN/CV will be 1V/oct
        FMIN/CV (to modulate frequency)
        SPEED setting the base SPEED of the sample
        PAN to place the sample in the stereo field
        VOL volume of the smaple
        OUT the direct OUT of the sample player

    all the paramenters are repeated 4 times

    GLOBAL parameters is CHAIN IN of another mixer that will be summed to Channel L and R
    the idea is to have multiple QuadSimpler to have a BIG bank of samples
